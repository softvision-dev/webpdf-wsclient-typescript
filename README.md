# webPDF wsclient TypeScript
This repository contains a simplified and optimized client library for the webPDF server, and serves as an alternative to more complex REST APIs.
The library implements the required stubs and session management in ready-to-use interface classes and provides a common object based parameterization for webservice calls.
